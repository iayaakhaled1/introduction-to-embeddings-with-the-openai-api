# Text Embedding Models

Text embedding models create numerical representations from text inputs. This ability to encode text and capture its semantic meaning means that embedding models underpin many types of AI applications, like semantic search engines and recommendation engines.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll learn how to harness OpenAI's Embeddings model via the OpenAI API to create embeddings from text datasets and begin developing real-world applications. You'll also take a big step towards creating production-ready applications by learning about vector databases to efficiently store and query embedded texts.
